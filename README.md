# Serpent

My first game in python. It is an ascii version of the classic game 'Snake'. The game runs on the UNIX terminal. To use it in Windows follow this instructions:

1. Download [the corresponding file](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses).
2. Go to the directory with the file and install it with `pip`. For instance:
```python
pip install curses‑2.2‑cp35‑none‑win_amd64.whl
```
